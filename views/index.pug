    p Welcome to my NodeJS / Express enabled project displaying previous JavaScript projects worked through the Team Treehouse program. You will find below a showcase of my existing Techdegree work as a budding developer. Throughout the various projects, I have learned a wide array of logic and skill from writing forms, working with object-orientated programming, resourcing data from external data sets, and more. Please explore the site and thank you for visiting!

      each project of projects

          //- The paths in the link's href and img's src attributes
          //- The text 'Thumbnail' interpolated with the project title for the img's alt attribute
          //- The project title for the h5 element's text
