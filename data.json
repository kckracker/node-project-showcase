        "description": "I have compiled a list of 5 quotes from some of my more cherished books to display the use of JavaScript mechanics. In addition to displaying the quote, this project stores the values of author (source), book (citation), publication year (year), and, in some cases, tags attributed to the quote. As an added display of JavaScript knowledge and an additional aesthetical element, I have coded a function to return a random background color each time a new quote is pulled. The quotes will automatically refresh after 7 seconds of display to allow for reading time.",

Additionally, the project incorporates an array of buttons serving as a placeholder for specific sets, or pages, of data to allow for maneuvering through the data at will. To add to the maneuverability of the data, I created and placed a searchbar into the DOM that allows for user input to pull student data based on the names stored for each of the students.",

I have created two separate objects to handle the phrase logic and player interaction. The Phrase object places the phrase received from the Game object into the DOM and handles the logic of checking key input received from the player against it. The Game object handles the primary workload of game logic by removing the overlay, pushing data to the Phrase object, manipulating the DOM for correct / incorrect guesses, and ending the game upon success or failure.",
